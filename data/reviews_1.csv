I did like the flavor of this coffee -- bold but not bitter.  As to ""strength"" I wish that there was more coffee in each K-cup... I am accustomed to Starbuck's strength, and I have to set my Keurig to medium-cup size to get the strength I need.  This is not as cost-effective as -- say Jet Fuel (but I found Jet Fuel too bitter.)<br />If Wolfgang Puck would add more coffee to its K-cups, this would be a perfect coffee for me."

This was a few weeks ago and though I've since changed my sheets, the scent is still in my bed.  Ultimately, I stopped using it because it made me smell in a way I did not like.

High in fiber and trace minerals, I mostly eat these with diffeent flavors of sardines (kippers), tuna, and anything else that would go good with any other crackers. This is part of my change to a healthier diet, that I started about 6 years ago, now at age fifty. My blood pressure & cholesteral are the best they have ever been. My dentist has even stated my gums are looking healthier (no more bleeding gums) a first for me. On line with the teeth issue, these probably are to hard for those with loose or weak teeth. But if you want a decently tasty cracker, to replace bad snacking habits, their probably isn't anything better. I first came across these at Jason's Deli, so I googled them and read reviews as you are doing now.If you are not sure if you will like them try getting them at your local deli. They usually have a couple of flavors and are the smaller cracker not flatbread, but taste the same. Also over the years I have modified what I eat, first I started as a lo-carber, mostly eating my favorite meats etc., but my triglicerides were always high, so I started adding sardines & more nuts & fruits, skipping more often some of my favorites like fried chicken. But have found excellent & flavorful alternatives, dark chocolate Almonds, some Sara Lee breads, lo-carb brands of tortillas.I still fall off once in a while & eat out often, but always get back on course. I feel better and healthier & actually enjoy & look forward to eating all the varieties of foods I've painstakingly researched over the years. Which I keep on hand, so as not to eat bad too often."

I gave the cookies a rating of 5 stars though because i havent eaten a cookie in about 4 years without getting sick.  This is because I have severe allergies to wheat and soy.  Pretty much every cookie you will find in a normal grocery store will have one if not both of these ingrediants.  So when I found Nana's cookies I was as happy as can be.  Yes the texture is different than a wheat cookie but it's better than going without cookies.  It also doesnt hurt that these cookies are delicious.  If you are like me and have a very limited diet these cookies are  a very welcome addition to that diet.

The flavor is very strong and captivating -- like a lemon with the tartness strength of a cranberry.

It made me wonder whether Coffee Masters uses the same equipment to make both a chocolate raspberry flavor and the dark chocolate decadence flavor, and if the flavors got mixed during the manufacturing process.<br /><br />Since then, I have ordered it several more times and have been more satisfied with it. There are times, however, when those burned flavor notes creep back in, depending on the bag. I sometimes wonder if Coffee Masters overroasts their beans.<br /><br />I originally bought this coffee instead of the chocolate coffee I used to regularly enjoy but could not find on Amazon, Brothers Gourmet Coffee Chocolate Swirl.  The Coffee Masters Dark Chocolate Decadence bean is darker, oilier, and richer than the Brothers bean.  The Brothers bean coffee is milder, more like Swiss chocolate.<br /><br />I still might prefer the medium-bean Brothers Blend over this coffee, even though it is a medium bean and not a dark bean, as the flavor profile tastes more like real chocolate.<br /><br />UPDATE: I am now actively seeking out coffees that are fair trade or direct trade or advertise ethical practices. Those that ignore the plight of the farmer and show no transparency in the process of the coffee from field to table I do not buy any longer. So this brand is no longer one that I will purchase. Plus they engage in farming activities that are not ecologically sound. I suggest starting with Intelligentsia."

While it definitely is ""natural"", I would not agree with the ""alternative to soda"" aspect.  Specifically, the liquid is much closer in consistency to juice, and in fact, has more sugar than juice (over 30 grams per 8.3 ounces).  Sure, it's lightly carbonated, but that alone doesn't make this drink a soda.  Also, if you wanted something natural, I'd go with Hansen's sodas, or a number of natural sodas, which are definitely sodas.  This drink is basically juice with carbonation.<br /><br />The other notable issue I had with this was its size.  8.3 oounces doesn't get you far (3 gulps, maybe?), and coupled with the thickness of the drink (since it IS juice, with quite a bit of natural sugar), you don't get very much thirst quenching effect from this.  The 100% juice also accounts for the strong aftertaste.<br /><br />Finally, natural sugar is still sugar, and has just as many calories.  This stuff wouldn't make the cut in most school vending policies, with its high sugar content.  And I wouldn't give this to my kids.  Instead, a couple of CapriSun Roaring Waters juice pouches (which each have about 1/4 the amount of sugar) would do the trick for them.<br /><br />Not recommended, sorry."

I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes.  It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored ""cake"".  I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment.  After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.<br /><br />In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient.  At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes.  High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.<br /><br />All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have.  One of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year.<br /><br />I am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition, but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash."

The 1st few days he suggest going meatless before building a foundation and reintroducing chicken, fish, and then other meats. I made chili with this. It doesn't taste just like meat or anything like that, but the texture is spot on when u mix in a bunch of other things. I'm not sure how it would turn out just on a bun. If I go that route I will have to season very well. Before making the chili I was a little worried so i cooked up all my veggies and seasoning in a separate pot. Browned this ""beef"" in another pan and added it into the mix later. Cooking this alone it smelled funny, and I was worried it would taste the way it smelled. I'm very sensitive to smell and taste of things. I can taste this in the mix of things but not so much. More than anything I'm busy looking for a taste. One thing I can say is the texture is pretty good for the consistency of meat except its much lighter and thinner less clumpy than real ground beef. If I had to give up beef for the rest of my life and pick this I wouldn't but if cows disappeared off the face of the earth I would be fine with taking this as a substitute."
